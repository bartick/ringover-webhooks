Ringover Webhook API Integration
================================

Description
-----------
This project provides a complete implementation of a webhook integration using FastAPI to handle Ringover events.
It includes endpoints for various types of webhook events such as call events, contact events, contact search events,
smart routing events, webhook messages, and IVR events.

Each endpoint:
  - Verifies the HMAC signature to ensure authenticity.
  - Validates the incoming JSON payload.
  - Logs the event details.
  - Stores events in a MySQL database.
  - Returns sample responses based on the Ringover documentation.
